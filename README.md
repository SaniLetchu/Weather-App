# Weather-App
Project: Weather App from Odin Project

During this project I practiced using APIs, eslint and prettier.
And still practicing using npm and webpack.

This weather app will display current basic weather data on wanted location and also displays the local time at that location.
The weather app also displays an icon appropriate for the current weather. You can change the displayed temperatures from Celcius to fahrenheit.
